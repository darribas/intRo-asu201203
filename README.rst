Notes
=====

* **Dani slides**: if you want to obtain the html version we used in the
  workshop, you can use `landslide <https://github.com/adamzap/landslide>`_
  and convert the ``rst`` file.

* **Nick slides**: if you're feeling adventurous and want to investigate latex in addition to R then check out the `wikibook <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX>`_. Otherwise, the PDF will open just fine :)
